        <h2>Abstract</h2>
        <p>We present Reverse Inference Optimization (RIO), a simple yet effective approach to improve the robustness of zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) system with codec language modeling. RIO is inspired by the recent advancement in reinforcement learning from human feedback, nevertheless, it empowers the TTS model itself to define the "preference", instead of relying on human annotators. To achieve it, we propose a new concept of reverse inference based on Bayesian formula, which indicates that beyond synthesizing high-quality speech, a robust TTS model should be able to leverage this synthesized speech as prompt for further generation. Reverse inference imposes a underlying but high-level requirement on TTS robustness, thus selecting those representative exemplars from self-generated samples to guide subsequent optimization towards robust direction. This sampling-annotating-learning pipeline eliminates the need for reward model or pairwise preference data, yet it significantly improve the robustness of zero-shot TTS by mitigating the mismatch problem between training and inference. We conduct both subjective and objective experiments to demonstrate the efficacy of RIO in terms of mean opinion score, word error rate, and speaker similarity. Moreover, RIO reduces the ratio of bad cases to nearly 0%, which even achieves the performance of ground-truth speech.
